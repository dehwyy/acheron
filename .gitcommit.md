# Commit Message Naming Convention

To maintain consistency and clarity in the project, the following commit message naming convention should be followed for all commits in the project consisting of **web**, **libraries**, and **apps**.

## General Format
\<type>(\<scope>): \<message>


Where:
- `<type>`: The type of change (describes what was done).
- `<scope>`: (Optional) The part of the application affected by the change (e.g., `frontend`, `backend`, `library`).
- `<message>`: A short description of the change.

## Commit Types

Use the following standard types to describe the purpose of the commit:

- `feat`: Adding new functionality.
- `fix`: Fixing a bug.
- `docs`: Documentation updates.
- `style`: Changes that do not affect functionality (e.g., code formatting, indentation).
- `refactor`: Code refactoring that does not fix a bug or add a feature.
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests.
- `chore`: General tasks such as updating dependencies, build settings, etc.
- `ci`: Changes to CI/CD configuration.
- `build`: Changes related to the build system or dependencies.
- `perf`: Improving performance.
- `wip`: Work in progress (commit to save progress).

## Examples

### Frontend

- `feat(frontend): add new button component`
- `fix(frontend): fix issue with button click`
- `style(frontend): align text in the button`
- `refactor(frontend): refactor file structure`
- `docs(frontend): update documentation for components`

### Backend

- `feat(backend): add new authentication endpoint`
- `fix(backend): fix token validation issue`
- `perf(backend): optimize database queries`
- `chore(backend): update backend dependencies`
- `test(backend): add tests for new endpoint`

### Libraries

- `feat(library): add utility for string manipulation`
- `fix(library): fix bug in JSON parser`
- `chore(library): update library documentation`

## Message Length Limitations

- The main message should be no longer than 72 characters to improve readability in git logs and outputs.

## Use of Present Tense

- Commit messages should be written in the present tense. For example, use:
  - `Add new functionality`
  - Not `Added new functionality`

## Complete Commit Examples

```shell
feat(frontend): add registration form component fix(backend):
fix issue with saving data to the database
refactor(library): refactor report generation function
docs(frontend): update documentation for form components
```
